# YouTubeApi Project

**This project is done as a practical work under supervision of the Light-IT company.**

Front-end part.<br>
As a front-end part I've done several simple HTML-pages just to test the functionality of my project.

Back-end part.<br>
All parts of technical task were completed and implemented in this project.

**Special info**

In order for project to work you must create a new file named "youtubeapi_key.py" in "default_app" folder and add your YouTubeApi key in there as shown:
 * YOUTUBE_API_KEY = 'YourKeyHere'

Also there is boolean const variable that you can change in order to turn off or on the caching function:
 * default_project/settings.py -> CACHING_STATUS
